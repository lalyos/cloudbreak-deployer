# Interactive mode

Start the shell with `cbd util cloudbreak-shell`. This will launch the Cloudbr shell inside a Docker container and you are ready to start using it.

### Create a cloud credential

In order to start using Cloudbreak you will need to have an AWS cloud use configured. Note that Cloudbreak **does not** store you cloud user details - we work around the concept of [IAM](http://aws.amazon.com/iam/) - on Amazon (or other cloud providers) you will have to create an IAM role, a policy and associate that with your Cloudbreak account.

```
credential createEC2 --description “description" --name “myCredentialName" --roleArn "arn:aws:iam::NUMBER:role/cloudbreak-ABC" --sshKeyUrl “URL towards your AWS public key"
```

Alternatively you can upload your public key from a file as well, by using the `—sshKeyPath` switch. You can check whether the credential was creates successfully by using the `credential list` command. You can switch between your cloud credential - when you’d like to use one and act with that you will have to use:

```
credential select --id #ID of the credential
```

### Create a template

A template gives developers and systems administrators an easy way to create and manage a collection of cloud infrastructure related resources, maintaining and updating them in an orderly and predictable fashion. A template can be used repeatedly to create identical copies of the same stack (or to use as a foundation to start a new stack).

```
template createEC2 --name awstemplate --description aws-template  --region EU_WEST_1 --instanceType M3Xlarge --volumeSize 100 --volumeCount 2
```
You can check whether the template was created successfully by using the `template list` command. Check the template and select it if you are happy with it:

```
template show --id #ID of the template

template select --id #ID of the template
```
### Create a stack

Stacks are template `instances` - a running cloud infrastructure created based on a template. Use the following command to create a stack to be used with your Hadoop cluster:

```
stack create --name “myStackName" --nodeCount 10
```
### Select a blueprint

We ship default Hadoop cluster blueprints with Cloudbreak. You can use these blueprints or add yours. To see the available blueprints and use one of them please use:

```
blueprint list

blueprint select --id #ID of the blueprint
```
### Create a Hadoop cluster
You are almost done - one more command and this will create your Hadoop cluster on your favorite cloud provider. Same as the API, or UI this will use your `template`, and by using CloudFormation will launch a cloud `stack` - once the `stack` is up and running (cloud provisioning is done) it will use your selected `blueprint` and install your custom Hadoop cluster with the selected components and services. For the supported list of Hadoop components and services please check the [documentation](http://sequenceiq.com/cloudbreak/#supported-components).

```
cluster create --description “my cluster desc"
```
You are done - you can check the progress through the Ambari UI. If you log back to [Cloudbreak UI](https://cloudbreak.sequenceiq.com/) you can check the progress over there as well, and learn the IP address of Ambari.

### Automate the process
Each time you start the shell the executed commands are logged in a file line by line and later either with the `script` command or specifying an `—cmdfile` option the same commands can be executed again.
